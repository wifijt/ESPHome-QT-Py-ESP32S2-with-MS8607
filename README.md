# ESPHome-QT-Py-ESP32S2-with-MS8607
ESPhome config.yaml for an Adafruit QTPy ESP32S2 with a MS8607 Temp Pres Humidity sensor via Stemma QT
Many thanks to the library from Dan Jackson https://github.com/e28eta for the MS8607 TPH sensor and to Yuval Brik https://github.com/jhamhader for adding the Lolin S2 Mini board to ESPHome

The ESP32 S2 board is from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325
The MS8607 is also from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/4716

This config allows you to control the onboard neopixel via home assistant - on this board GPIO pin 38 needs to be driven high to enable the NeoPixel. By default it is low.
